Adding the generating closest neighbours improves really quick the convergence, but it takes several more time than just generating random paths/inbreeding. Also the convergence seems to take much longer, probably due to the lack of diversity (Max N paths, N being the number of nodes).
An option could be in the first generation create one of them (Probably the best fit of the generation), and then generate the next gen with a mixture of inbreeding and crossovers with random paths.
